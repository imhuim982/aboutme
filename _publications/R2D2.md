title: "R2D2: Recursive Transformer based on Differentiable Tree for Interpretable Hierarchical Language Modeling"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: 'Proposing an unsupervised structured encoder able to compose low-level constituents into high-level constituents without gold trees. The learned trees are highly consistent with human-annotated ones. The backbone of the encoder is a neural inside algorithm with heuristic pruning, thus the time and space complexity are both in linear.'
